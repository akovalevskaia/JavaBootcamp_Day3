Lesson in Employee Relationship
Fred Gibbs was in his early 60's, retired and had started a second career in catering.  However, he just couldn't seem to get to work on time.  Every day he was 2, 3, 5 minutes late.
However, he was a good worker, really clever, so the owner was in a quandary about how to deal with it.  Finally, one day he called Steve into the office for a talk.
Fred, I have to tell you, I like your work ethic, you do a top class job, but you're being late so often is quite a worry.'
'Yes, I realise that, sir, and I am working on it.' replied Fred.
'I'm pleased to hear that, you are a team player. It's odd though, you're coming in late. I know you're retired from the Royal Navy. What did they say if you came in late there?'
'They said, "Good morning, Admiral".'
